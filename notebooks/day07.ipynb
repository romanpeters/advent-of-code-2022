    "The filesystem consists of a tree of files (plain data) and directories (which can contain other directories or files). The outermost directory is called /. You can navigate around the filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the contents of the directory you're currently in.\n",

    "Within the terminal output, lines that begin with $ are commands you executed, very much like some modern computers:\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd` means change directory. This changes which directory is the current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument:\n",
    "- `cd x` moves in one level: it looks in the current directory for the directory named x and makes it the current directory.\n",
    "- `cd ..` moves out one level: it finds the directory that contains the current directory, then makes that directory the current directory.\n",
    "- `cd /` switches the current directory to the outermost directory, /.\n",
    "`ls` means list. It prints out all of the files and directories immediately contained by the current directory:\n",

    "- `dir xyz` means that the current directory contains a directory named xyz.\n",
